To do:


Consider creating a duration function that takes the action and returns a duration.  This hides the complexity of parsing the action from the primary function.

Create uid that is unique but not random.  This will allow updates to events.  Consider case_num-start_time-action[:12]@scottbrenner.com

Build separate ics for all, crim & civil.

Add summary data at 7:30 am on day after build:
	num event
	num by nac
	time to execute
	errors

Add text file that lists length of specific NAC trials.  Check this file when building duration.  If keyword in action then set duration to duration in this text file. E.g., {casenum, keyword, length [days, hrs]}
		A 10 01357, trial, 5
		A 11 00574, hearing, 10

Build separate ics for each judge and each all, crim & civil.
